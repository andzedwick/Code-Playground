# Code-Playground
This repository is a place to store miscellanious code/small projects. Larger projects will be stored in their own repository.
Code-Playground allows me to better organize small projects and gives me a single landing place to show some of code to potential employers.

This repository is meant for projects that have been completed and projects I'm currently working on.
